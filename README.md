## A one-stop-shop for managing vehicle service and repairs. 

As a group we use everything learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that will be able to showcase to potential employers.

## Description
A web based application for users to create an account and store personal vehicles. It has the ability to request service work for their car and save previous service work to that car to eliminate Service and Repair information about a car getting lost and make it easier for users to book in work with a workshop. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a full stack web application that controls car servicing and log books.
WHEN I open the site to the main homepage.
THEN I am presented with a page that gives me the option to log in or create a new User.
WHEN I create a new User I am asked for sign up details to create my account.
THEN I am logged into a page where I can add a Car to my account.
WHEN I create a new car I am asked for basic details about the car.
THEN That car is added to my list of cars, now I can either create a new car or request a job from the workshop.
WHEN I request a job with a workshop I can choose a type of job between 'Service & Inspection' or 'Repairs' and what time and date I would like it to be.
THEN My Job request is sent to the Workshop admins who can assign a Technician to the job.
WHEN A Technician has worked on a car they will create a service report for the car, describing what has been done or what could be done.
THEN That service will be attached to my car for later viewing
WHEN I return to my account dashboard
THEN I can see my Car(s)
WHEN I select a Car
THEN I can view all previous service reports attached to that car 
```

## Work Description
For this Project we utilised Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars and mySQL to create a functional and adaptable website that utilises back end functionality and database to retain user security and information. We used Tailwind for page layout and styling.
For the project we split the jobs into 5 parts and all worked on one each for the final website.

- Models for all website data
- User profile homepage
- Workshop homepage
- Technician homepage
- Initial homepage for login / signup

A major challenge we faced during this project included a deciding a final structure for our project, this influenced our models and how our pages would be set up. We initially over complicated our idea but by discussing ideas and goals as a group we simplified our end product and came up with a workable view of how the project should take shape. At different points we all had our own minor issues but as a group or with guidance we were able to eliminate any potential lager issues.

Our major success with this project has been working as a team and all doing our part and helping each other when one of us had a problem. Our communication was good and if something required attention everyone was quick to address the problem in a orderly manner and inform everyone else of the change and the problem it addresses.
