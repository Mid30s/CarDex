## Description
A web based application for users to create an account and store personal vehicles. It has the ability to request service work for their car and save previous service work to that car to eliminate Service and Repair information about a car getting lost and make it easier for users to book in work with a workshop. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a full stack web application that controls car servicing and log books.
WHEN I open the site to the main homepage.
THEN I am presented with a page that gives me the option to log in or create a new User.
WHEN I create a new User I am asked for sign up details to create my account.
THEN I am logged into a page where I can add a Car to my account.
WHEN I create a new car I am asked for basic details about the car.
THEN That car is added to my list of cars, now I can either create a new car or request a job from the workshop.
WHEN I request a job with a workshop I can choose a type of job between 'Service & Inspection' or 'Repairs' and what time and date I would like it to be.
THEN My Job request is sent to the Workshop admins who can assign a Technician to the job.
WHEN A Technician has worked on a car they will create a service report for the car, describing what has been done or what could be done.
THEN That service will be attached to my car for later viewing
WHEN I return to my account dashboard
THEN I can see my Car(s)
WHEN I select a Car
THEN I can view all previous service reports attached to that car 
```
